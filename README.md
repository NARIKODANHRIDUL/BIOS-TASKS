## HARDWARE CHALLENGES

#### Challenge 1
> Aim:- To find values of 'a' & 'b' which helps to get the Flag value from the given 
    TinkerCad circuit

#### Challenge 2 - 7Sniff
> Aim:- While testing our hardware challenge we tapped the communication happening between 7
    segment display and a shift register and obtained some data, but due to a faulty display, we
    were unable to see the flag. Find a way to use the code to display the flag on 7-segment.
    Hint: Tinkercad loves LSB first. Flag format {FLAG= . . . . } TinkerCad circuit - Given in
    the Challenge 1

## TASK 1 (Debounce)
#### TRAFFIC LIGHT Part 1
> Aim:-
   Create a traffic light signal using 3 LED's (any colour of your choice) such that each of them turns on after every 1 sec respectively.
   
#### Debounce part 2
> Aim:-
    Design the same circuit as above but this time use a single push button to turn on and off the LEDs. For example, LED is switched off initially, when the push button is pressed red led turns on, when the same push button is pressed again yellow light turns on and red turns off and similarly when green turns on red and yellow turns off

## WIRELESS CHALLENGES
#### Challenge 1
> Aim:- 
Make a GNURadio flowgraph that takes an audio input from your sound card and maps its frequency domain representation

#### Challenge 2
> Aim:- 
Make 2 GNU Radio flowgraphs implementing an AM Receiver and Transmitter and test its working. You can refer to the GNU Radio wiki for necessary details

#### Challenge 3
> Aim:-
Make a writeup explaining the concept of an IQ signal.
